 YOU ARE NOW THE PROJECT LEAD FOR DEPENDENCYWARDEN.
Your task is to systematically implement all fixes from the uploaded checklists to make the application production-ready. Prioritize critical security issues , error handling , accessibility , and performance before addressing lower-priority items.

üîç STEP 1: FULL STATUS CHECK
Audit the current codebase against the following checklists:
Security vulnerabilities (localStorage ‚Üí secure storage, input sanitization, CSRF)
Error boundaries (global vs. component-specific)
Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
TypeScript compilation errors
Lazy loading and bundle optimization
Generate a prioritized task list based on the uploaded checklists. Include:
Critical issues (e.g., security, TypeScript errors)
High-priority fixes (error handling, accessibility)
Medium/low-priority improvements (testing, documentation)
üõ†Ô∏è STEP 2: IMPLEMENT FIXES BY CATEGORY
1. SECURITY HARDENING (CRITICAL)
Replace localStorage with secure token storage (use httpOnly cookies or secureStorage.ts).
Add input sanitization using DOMPurify and regex validation.
Implement CSRF protection for API requests.
Validate environment variables (create .env files and envValidator.ts).
Fix hardcoded secrets in components (e.g., IntegrationStatus.tsx).
2. ERROR HANDLING & RESILIENCE (CRITICAL)
Add component-specific error boundaries (wrap major components like Dashboard, Modal, Sidebar in <ComponentErrorBoundary>).
Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API requests.
Add fallback UIs for loading/error states.
Integrate Sentry for granular error logging.
3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (CRITICAL)
Replace hardcoded imports with lazy loading for routes (use React.lazy + Suspense).
Optimize re-renders with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback.
Extract constants/config files to reduce magic numbers.
Enable tree-shaking and analyze bundle size (source-map-explorer).
4. ACCESSIBILITY (WCAG 2.1 AA) (CRITICAL)
Add ARIA labels, roles, and descriptions to all interactive elements.
Ensure keyboard navigation works across modals, dropdowns, and tables.
Fix focus management (e.g., trap focus in modals).
Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.
5. TYPE SAFETY & TESTING (HIGH PRIORITY)
Replace any types with strict TypeScript interfaces.
Add runtime validation for API responses (use Zod or Yup).
Write unit tests for core logic (e.g., use-auth.tsx, queryClient.ts).
Add test IDs for E2E testing.
6. CODE QUALITY & DOCUMENTATION (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Extract reusable utilities (e.g., constants.ts, themeUtils.ts).
Add JSDoc comments and Storybook documentation.
Enforce consistent naming conventions and code style.
üìã STEP 3: VERIFY FIXES AGAINST CHECKLISTS
For each fix, provide:

File path edited (e.g., client/src/lib/secureStorage.ts)
Code snippet showing the change
Checklist alignment (e.g., "Fixes: Security Checklist #1")
Verification status (‚úÖ Resolved / ‚ùå Pending)
üîÑ STEP 4: FINAL VALIDATION & REPORT
Run npm run build to confirm no TypeScript errors.
Test routing, lazy loading, and error boundaries manually.
Generate a production readiness report with:
‚úÖ Passed categories (security, accessibility, etc.)
üö´ Remaining issues
üìà Final recommendation (Deploy / Do Not Deploy)
Take screenshots only for major milestones (e.g., successful build, fixed accessibility).
‚ö†Ô∏è RULES FOR AGENT
DO NOT CLAIM COMPLETION until all critical issues are resolved.
Prioritize concrete code changes over vague suggestions.
Fix TypeScript errors before implementing new features.
Use tools/libs mentioned in checklists (e.g., Zod, React Query, Sentry).
Document every change with file paths and code snippets.
‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA
All security vulnerabilities patched
Zero TypeScript compilation errors
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
Component-specific error boundaries implemented
Lazy loading functional for non-critical routes
Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
Let me know your findings and begin fixing the outstanding issues now.
