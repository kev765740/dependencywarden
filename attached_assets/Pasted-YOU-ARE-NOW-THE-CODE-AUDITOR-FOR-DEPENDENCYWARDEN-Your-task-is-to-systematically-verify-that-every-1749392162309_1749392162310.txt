YOU ARE NOW THE CODE AUDITOR FOR DEPENDENCYWARDEN.
Your task is to systematically verify that every item from the uploaded checklists has been fully implemented and fixed .

🧭 STEP 1: FULL STATUS CHECK
Audit the entire codebase against these checklists:
Security vulnerabilities (localStorage → secure storage, CSRF, XSS)
Error boundaries (global vs. component-specific)
Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, ARIA labels)
TypeScript compilation errors
Lazy loading and bundle optimization
Input validation and sanitization
Generate a prioritized task list with:
✅ Fully resolved issues
❌ Unresolved issues (with file paths)
⚠️ Partially fixed issues
🔧 STEP 2: VERIFY FIXES BY CATEGORY
For each checklist item , provide:

File path where the fix was implemented
Code snippet showing the fix
Checklist alignment (e.g., "Fixes: Security Checklist #1")
Verification status (✅ Resolved / ❌ Pending)
SECURITY VERIFICATION
localStorage → secure token storage (check SecurityCopilotFloat.tsx)
Input sanitization with DOMPurify (inputSanitization.ts)
CSRF protection in API calls
Environment variable validation
XSS protection for dynamic content
ERROR HANDLING VERIFICATION
Component-specific error boundaries (App.tsx, pages/*.tsx)
Fallback UIs for failed operations
Retry logic with exponential backoff
Sentry integration for error logging
ACCESSIBILITY VERIFICATION (WCAG 2.1 AA)
ARIA labels added to all interactive elements
Keyboard navigation working
Focus management (modals, dropdowns)
Color contrast compliance
TYPE SAFETY & PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION
All any types replaced with interfaces
React.memo/useMemo optimizations
Lazy loading for routes (check App.tsx)
Bundle size under 500KB gzipped
📋 STEP 3: FINAL VERIFICATION REPORT
Run npm run build and confirm zero TypeScript errors
Test routing, lazy loading, and error boundaries manually
Generate a final production readiness report with:
✅ Passed categories (security, accessibility, etc.)
🚫 Remaining issues
📈 Final recommendation (Deploy / Do Not Deploy)
Take screenshots only for major milestones (e.g., successful build, fixed accessibility).
⚠️ RULES FOR AGENT
DO NOT CLAIM COMPLETION until all critical issues are resolved
Prioritize concrete code changes over vague suggestions
Fix TypeScript errors before implementing new features
Use tools/libs mentioned in checklists (e.g., Zod, React Query, Sentry)
Document every change with file paths and code snippets
✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
All security vulnerabilities patched
Zero TypeScript compilation errors
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
Component-specific error boundaries implemented
Lazy loading functional for non-critical routes
Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
Let me know your findings and begin verifying the outstanding issues now.
