Full Checklist Verification Plan
Run this verification process to ensure every item from your checklists is fully implemented:

A. Security Verification
Token Storage
Confirm localStorage is replaced with secure storage (e.g., secureStorage.ts).
Check that tokens use httpOnly cookies or secure session management.
Input Sanitization
Validate all forms use inputSanitization.ts (regex patterns, DOMPurify).
Test XSS payloads in inputs to ensure sanitization works.
CSRF Protection
Verify productionSecurity.ts includes CSRF token generation/validation.
Confirm API calls include CSRF headers.
Environment Variables
Check .env files exist for all environments.
Ensure envValidator.ts validates required variables.
B. Error Handling & Resilience
Error Boundaries
Confirm App.tsx wraps routes in ComponentErrorBoundary.
Test error scenarios (e.g., API failures) to verify fallback UIs.
Retry Logic
Validate retryLogic.ts implements exponential backoff.
Simulate network failures to ensure retries work.
Sentry Integration
Confirm error logging sends data to Sentry.
Test error reporting with a forced exception.
C. Performance Optimization
Lazy Loading
Check App.tsx uses React.lazy for non-critical routes.
Verify Suspense fallbacks (e.g., LoadingSpinner) work.
Memoization
Confirm useMemo, React.memo, and useCallback are used where needed.
Use React DevTools to inspect re-renders.
Bundle Size
Run npm run build and analyze bundle size (target: <500KB gzipped).
Use source-map-explorer to identify large dependencies.
D. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
ARIA Labels
Confirm all interactive elements (buttons, forms) have aria-label or aria-labelledby.
Test screen reader compatibility (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).
Keyboard Navigation
Navigate the app using only the keyboard (tabs, arrows, Enter).
Ensure modals trap focus and dropdowns are accessible.
Color Contrast
Use tools like Lighthouse or axe-core to verify contrast ratios.
Fix any low-contrast text/buttons.
E. Type Safety & Testing
TypeScript
Ensure no any types or unsafe assertions (!).
Validate Zod/Yup schemas for API responses.
Testing
Run unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library) and confirm >80% coverage.
Test E2E flows (e.g., login, form submission) with Cypress or Playwright.
üöÄ 2. Final QA for Deployment
Run this QA checklist to ensure the app is ready for production:

Security
‚úÖ
Token storage, CSRF, input sanitization verified
Error Handling
‚úÖ
Component boundaries, retry logic, Sentry integration
Accessibility
‚úÖ
ARIA labels, keyboard nav, contrast compliance
Performance
‚úÖ
Lazy loading, memoization, bundle size <500KB
Type Safety
‚úÖ
No
any
types, Zod validation
Testing
‚úÖ
Unit/E2E tests pass, 80%+ coverage
Steps to Finalize:
Fix LicensePolicy.tsx Export Issue
Remove duplicate exports (e.g., default export conflicts).
Run Final Build
bash


1
npm run build
Ensure no TypeScript errors.
Test Locally
bash


1
npm run preview
Verify all pages load and function as expected.
Generate Accessibility Report
Use axe-core or Lighthouse to confirm WCAG compliance:
bash


1
npx axe-linter
Deploy Readiness
Confirm environment variables are set in production.
Set up monitoring (Sentry, PostHog, Core Web Vitals).
üìã 3. Final Deployment Checklist
Use this to decide whether to deploy:

‚úÖ All critical security issues resolved
‚ùå/‚úÖ
‚úÖ Component-specific error boundaries implemented
‚ùå/‚úÖ
‚úÖ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
‚ùå/‚úÖ
‚úÖ Lazy loading functional
‚ùå/‚úÖ
‚úÖ TypeScript errors resolved
‚ùå/‚úÖ
‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
‚ùå/‚úÖ
Final Recommendation :

Deploy if all items are ‚úÖ.
Delay if any items are ‚ùå or ‚ö†Ô∏è.
