# AI Security Features Enhancement - Implementation Prompt for Replit Agent

## Overview
I need to enhance my existing AI security features with improved reliability, better error handling, and enhanced user experience. The current implementation has several critical issues that need to be addressed.

## Current Issues to Fix
1. **Missing API request handler** - `apiRequest()` function is undefined causing runtime errors
2. **Poor error handling** - No fallback mechanisms when AI services fail
3. **Basic UI/UX** - Missing loading states, confidence indicators, and user feedback
4. **No conversation context** - Each message is processed independently
5. **Limited reasoning capabilities** - Simple request/response without proper context building

## Files to Update/Create

### 1. Create API Request Handler
**File:** `client/src/utils/apiRequest.ts`
- Implement robust API request function with retry logic
- Add exponential backoff for failed requests
- Include proper error handling and TypeScript types
- Add request/response logging for debugging

### 2. Enhanced AI Engine 
**File:** `server/aiSecurityEngine.ts` (replace existing)
- Implement fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable
- Add conversation context and memory
- Improve prompt engineering for better security analysis
- Add structured response parsing
- Implement confidence scoring
- Add rule-based fallback responses

### 3. Improved Frontend Component
**File:** `client/src/pages/ai-security.tsx` (enhance existing)
- Add proper loading states and typing indicators
- Implement confidence indicators for AI responses
- Add quick question suggestions
- Improve message display with better formatting
- Add connection status indicator
- Implement auto-scroll for messages
- Add vulnerability selection sidebar with better UX

### 4. Additional Requirements
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Add proper error boundaries in React components
- Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add responsive design for mobile devices

## Implementation Priority
1. **Critical (Fix first):** API request handler and basic error handling
2. **High:** Enhanced AI engine with fallbacks and better prompting
3. **Medium:** Improved UI/UX features and conversation context
4. **Low:** Additional polish and accessibility features

## Technical Specifications
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS for styling
- **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript
- **AI Services:** OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and Google Gemini as fallback
- **Database:** Existing schema for storing remediation suggestions
- **State Management:** React Query for server state, React hooks for local state

## Key Features to Implement
1. **Robust Error Handling:** Multiple fallback layers, graceful degradation
2. **Context Awareness:** Maintain conversation history and vulnerability context  
3. **User Experience:** Loading states, confidence indicators, quick questions
4. **Performance:** Request caching, optimistic updates, efficient re-renders
5. **Security:** Input validation, rate limiting considerations, secure API calls

## Testing Requirements
- Test all error scenarios (network failures, API limits, invalid responses)
- Verify fallback mechanisms work correctly
- Test conversation flow and context preservation
- Validate TypeScript types and interfaces
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow React best practices (useCallback, useMemo where appropriate)
- Ensure all async operations have proper error handling

## Success Criteria
- Zero runtime errors related to undefined functions
- Graceful handling of AI service outages
- Improved user engagement with quick questions and context
- Sub-2-second response times for cached/fallback responses
- Proper TypeScript coverage with no `any` types

Please implement these changes step by step, starting with the critical fixes first. Make sure to test each component as you build it and ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality.
