Based on the provided snippets from the project documentation, here are the identified bugs and issues that need to be addressed:
SBOM Generation:
The “Generate SBOM” feature should produce a valid Software Bill of Materials in at least one framework (e.g., SPDX JSON or CycloneDX XML).
The backend logic needs to be fixed so that SBOMs appear in the “Recent SBOMs” list upon generation.
Auto-Fix Pull Requests:
Selecting “Auto-Fix PR” on a vulnerability should generate a real GitHub PR with correct diff changes (version bump or patch).
If any part of the auto-fix flow (branch creation, commit, PR open) is failing, it needs to be repaired end-to-end.
Team Management:
The “Create Team” feature should allow users to add teammates via email or invite link.
Any server or front-end errors preventing team creation need to be fixed, ensuring team members can see shared repositories and alert notifications.
API Integrations:
All external API integrations (GitHub, OSV, NPM registry, Stripe, SendGrid/SMTP, Slack) should be audited to confirm data is fetched and posted correctly.
Any broken endpoints or misconfigured environment variables that block live data flow need to be fixed.
Executive Analytics:
The “Executive Analytics” page should show real, aggregated data (scan counts, alert trends, ROI metrics).
The plan upgrade flow from this page should be enabled, allowing users to click “Upgrade Plan” and complete the Stripe checkout.
Billing & Subscription Management:
The billing page should show the correct plan (Free/Pro), pricing tiers, and current subscription status.
Users should be able to upgrade, downgrade, and cancel subscriptions via Stripe.
Any UI or API errors that prevent successful payment need to be fixed.
Referrals System:
On the “Referrals” page, referral links should be generated per user, and referral counts/bonuses should display correctly.
Any broken stats or links should be fixed so users see accurate referral data.
Settings & Account Management:
In “Settings,” all user information fields (name, email, password change, notification preferences) should be present and editable.
Slack webhook, email preferences, and GitHub token fields should save properly and affect notifications as intended.
Any missing or broken form validation and feedback messages need to be addressed.
After addressing these issues, a summary of the updates and resolutions should be provided, confirming that all core functionality works with real data and no errors. This should be treated as a comprehensive production sweep, ensuring that no checkpoints are saved until every item is validated and fixed.
